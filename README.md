Trip Price Calculator
=====================

Calculates the price for fuel based on the distance of the drive.

TPC uses [NoodleJS](http://noodlejs.com/) to scrape data from the Israeli government fuel price page which is updated monthly.

It then gets the distance between origin and destination using the [Google Maps Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/).
